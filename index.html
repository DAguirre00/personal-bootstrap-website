                        <p>
                            My name is Dominic Aguirre, and I am a Computer Science student studying at Southern New Hampshire university. 
                            I was born and raised in Massachusetts but lived in Rhode Island for a few years before moving to New Hampshire 
                            where I have been since. I have started learning several languages such as C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and java scrip. 
                            I am always looking for new opportunities for learning and will be undergoing many projects to help further my 
                            understanding of Computer Science. I will be using this website to host all my projects for anyone to see and to 
                            learn about web development. I will also host a gallery of my paintings if that is what you have come to see.
